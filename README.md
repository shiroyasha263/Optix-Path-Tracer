# Optix-Ray-Tracer

So, as of now I have made the following parts of my ray tracer - 
 - OptixHello: to check if optix is running fine
 - OptixPipeline: to check the code to create a simple pipeline and create an image
 - OptixWindow: generate the image onto a window using GLFW
 - OptixSphere: add a sphere on to the screen
 - OptixLambert: add a lambertian object
 - OptixTry: working on both a metalic and dielectric object
