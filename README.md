# Optix-Ray-Tracer

So, as of now I have made the following parts of my ray tracer - 
 - i have created a renderer in which I can put in multiple spherical and triangular meshes, each of material type being - dielectric, specular and diffuse.
 - Besides that I have added a feature to add isotropic medium inside the renderer.
 - Will add ways to see if we are inside the volume or outside the volume.
 - Will have to organize the code, as of now its a bit of a mess.
 - Add ui elements sometimes later.
 - Get ways to render volumertic medium faster.
